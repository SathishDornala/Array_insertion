## Introduction
In data structures, arrays are commonly used for storing elements in contiguous memory. Inserting an element at a specific position in an array requires shifting the existing elements accordingly. This program provides examples of inserting at the following positions:
1. **Beginning**
2. **Middle**
3. **End**

## Features
- Insert an element at any position (beginning, middle, or end) in an array.
- Demonstrates how to handle element shifting during insertion.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of C programming and arrays.
- A working C compiler (e.g., GCC).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or copy the code.
2. Compile the code using a C compiler:
   ```bash
   gcc array_insertion.c -o array_insertion
./array_insertion
